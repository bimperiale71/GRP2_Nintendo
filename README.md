Nintendo has been a dominant force in the gaming industry for decades, 
consistently delivering innovative and beloved titles that have shaped modern gaming. 
But what defines the best Nintendo game, and which platforms have been the most popular? 

This analysis explores these questions using data-driven insights through Python and Excel, 
focusing on the following five major franchises: Super Mario, Pokemon, Fire Emblem, Kirby,
and The Legend of Zelda. We hypothesize that The Legend of Zelda will emerge
as the top franchise based on our criteria, with the Nintendo Switch being the best performing platform.
